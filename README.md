fehgui
======

<b>*</b> WHAT IS IT?

A perl/tk frontend to the feh wallpaper utility.

<b>*</b> WHAT CAN IT DO?

It allows the user to quickly switch the wallpaper without resorting to the command line. It does <b>NOT</b> support feh's more complex features as of yet (and may never).

<b>*</b> WHY SHOULD I USE IT?

No reason, really. I made it to quickly choose a wallpaper out of a directory containing close to a thousand different images. It worked well; I decided to put it out there for anyone who may be interested.

<b>*</b> WHAT DEPENDENCIES DOES IT NEED?

Perl and the tk module. This may change if I ever decide to add more features.

<b>*</b> HOW DO I INSTALL?

It's a simple perl script. You can call it directly with the perl interpreter or move it somewhere your $PATH can see and make it executable.

<b>*</b> WILL YOU ADD <i>X</i> FEATURE?

Probably not, but feel free to ask. This is just a side project and as such  it's low on my list of priorities.
